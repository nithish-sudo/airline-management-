Key Features:
Add new flights with specific origin, destination, and seat capacity.
Book tickets for passengers on available flights.
Cancel tickets for passengers.
View available flights and their details.
View the list of passengers for a particular flight.

Flight: Represents a flight, containing flight number, origin, destination, seat capacity, and a list of passengers.
AirlineManagementSystem: Manages multiple flights and provides methods to book, cancel, and view flight details.
main(): The entry point to the system, which provides a command-line interface for interaction.
Features
Add Flight:
Allows you to add a flight by specifying the flight number, origin, destination, and seat capacity.

The system automatically checks if the flight has remaining seats before booking.

Future Enhancements
The project is a basic prototype, and the following enhancements can be made:

Persistent Storage: Implement a database (SQLite, MySQL) to store flight and booking information permanently.
GUI: A graphical user interface (GUI) could be added to improve usability.
Flight Scheduling: Add more complex scheduling for flights (departure and arrival times).
Pricing Model: Include dynamic pricing models for tickets.
Real-time Seat Availability: Integrate real-time seat availability updates.
